##Crypto Sphere

This is the front end repository for the Crypto Sphere application. This application was built using 
the MERN stack and in this repo the code for the React and Node.js portion of the code is within.

Full Stack application using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs.) I created this application in order to serve as a central hub and for users to be able to make their own cryptocurrency watchlist as well as see current headlines related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I used two APIs to create this application: one from CoinMarketCap.com to pull up-to-second data related to the top 1000 cryptocurrencies; and the other from NewsApi.org to populate the page with news articles related to crypto. The user can create an account and add coins to their own watchlist, as well as delete the ones no longer wanted.
